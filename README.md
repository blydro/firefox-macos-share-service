# Open in Firefox share extension
![screenshot](https://github.com/blydro/firefox-macos-share-service/raw/master/screenshot.png)

## What?
The MacOS share menu is beautifully integrated into MacOS. Wouldnâ€™t it be useful if all those buttons present in every good MacOS application had an option to open links in Firefox?

## How?
In the future this could maybe support other browsers or even have a config app. Pull Requests welcome! Maybe a full app is possible here.

## Where?
A fully working, but nevertheless proof-of-concept release [is available here](https://github.com/blydro/firefox-macos-share-service/releases/download/1.1.0/openInFirefox.app.zip)
