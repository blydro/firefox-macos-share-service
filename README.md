# Open in Firefox share extension

## What?
The MacOS share menu is beautifully integrated into MacOS. Wouldnâ€™t it be useful if all those buttons present in every good MacOS application had an option to open links in Firefox?

## How?
The code needs a lot of clean-up. In the future this could maybe support other browsers or even have a config app. Right now the default MacOS xib is thrown up at the user when the app is launched.

## Where?
A fully working, but nevertheless proof-of-concept release [is available here](https://github.com/blydro/firefox-macos-share-service/releases/download/0.0.1/openInFirefox.app.zip)
