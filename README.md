# Open in Firefox share extension

## What?
The MacOS share menu is beautifully integrated into MacOS. Wouldnâ€™t it be useful if all those buttons present in every good MacOS application had an option to open links in Firefox?

## How?
The code needs a lot of clean-up. In the future this could maybe support other browsers or even have a config app. Right now the default MacOS xib is thrown up at the user when the app is launched.
